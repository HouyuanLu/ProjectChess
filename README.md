# ProjectChess
## The _goal_ of this project is to build an *advanced program* that can play *gobang*.
### This program is made in **C++**.

**IMPORTANT_NOTE: The .exe might not run because ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll``` and ```libstdc++-6.dll``` are missing. If you have a C/C++ compiler already, you can just copy  ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll```, ```libstdc++-6.dll```and ```libwinpthread-1.dll``` from the compiler's BIN folder to where the .exe is. Otherwise, please download ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll```, ```libstdc++-6.dll```and ```libwinpthread-1.dll``` from the ```Assets``` folder, and then copy these three files to the same folder as the .exe file (These three files in the ```Assets``` folder are directly copied from the my compiler's BIN folder and is safe to use).**
