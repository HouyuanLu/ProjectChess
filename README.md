# ProjectChess
## The _goal_ of this project is to build an *advanced program* that can play *gobang*.
### This program is made in **C++**.

**IMPORTANT_NOTE: The .exe might not run because ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll``` and ```libstdc++-6.dll``` are missing. In that case, please download ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll```, ```libstdc++-6.dll```and ```libwinpthread-1.dll``` in the ```Assets``` folder, and then copy these three files in the same folder as the .exe file. (These three files are directly copied from the compiler's BIN folder and is safe to use)**
