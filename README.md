# ProjectChess
## The _goal_ of this project is to build a program that can play *gobang*.
### This program is made in **C++**.
#### Latest Update: July 23 2022  -> *v3.1-beta*
**IMPORTANT_NOTE: The .exe package for the older versions (v2.3.3 and older) of this program might not run because ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll``` and ```libstdc++-6.dll``` are missing. In that case, you can either copy  ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll```, ```libstdc++-6.dll```and ```libwinpthread-1.dll``` from the compiler's BIN folder (if you have a compiler), or downloading these three files from the ```Assets``` folder, and pasting it to the same folder as the .exe file.**
