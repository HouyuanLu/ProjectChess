# ProjectChess
## The _goal_ of this project is to build an *advanced program* that can play *gobang*.
This program is made in ```C++```.

**IMPORTANT_NOTE: The exe might not run because that  ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll``` and ```libstdc++-6.dll``` are missing. In that case, please download the three ```.dll``` files in the ```assets``` folder.**
