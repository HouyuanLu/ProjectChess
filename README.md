# ProjectChess
## The _goal_ of this project is to build a program that can play *gobang*.
### This program is made in **C++**.
#### Latest Update: June 29 2022
**IMPORTANT_NOTE: The .exe package for the older versions (v2.3.3 and older) of this program might not run because ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll``` and ```libstdc++-6.dll``` are missing. If you have a C/C++ compiler already, you can just copy  ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll```, ```libstdc++-6.dll```and ```libwinpthread-1.dll``` from the compiler's BIN folder to where the .exe is. Otherwise, please download ```libgcc_s_seh-1.dll```, ```libstdc++-6.dll```and ```libwinpthread-1.dll``` from the ```Assets``` folder, and then copy these three files to the same folder as the .exe file.**
